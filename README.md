Titanic Passenger Survival Prediction

This project explores factors that influenced passenger survival during the sinking of the
RMS Titanic in 1912. We built a model to predict survival based on information like age,
gender, and class (socio-economic status) from passenger data.

Data
• We used the public Titanic dataset containing passenger information (survival,
class, age, gender, etc.).

Analysis
• We analyzed the data to understand patterns and cleaned any inconsistencies.
• We trained a model to predict survival based on passenger features.
• We evaluated the model's performance to see how well it could predict survival.

Results
• Our analysis confirms that women had a significantly higher survival rate
compared to men on the Titanic. This aligns with historical accounts prioritizing
women and children during evacuation.

Code
• The code for this project is in TitanicFinal.ipynb.
